# BinanceSMA
Trading bots for binance
- binanceSMA uses simple SMAs
- binanceBTC uses simpleSMAs but also uses btc sma to decide what candles to use
- tsl is quite simple bot to use trailing stoplosses in both directions

Work in progress... might even refactor later and clean this mess. Until then we just have to manage with these

Feel free to use it.
